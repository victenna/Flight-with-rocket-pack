Python coding in high school physics. For teachers, children and parents who enjoy coding. Jetpack flight animation is shown.
A good reason for a teacher to explain principle jet engine operation.  The animation demonstrates several stages of maneuvering:
vertical takeoff, U-turn, straight-ahead movement, 180-degree turn, and descent to the ground. To describe all maneuvering  stages
with Python code kids have to use  and apply the basic logical commands of the programming  language. This simulation is an important
and informative for schoolkids who study PROGRAMMING, physics and mathematics. Students in the process of creating a program learn 
a programming language and also master school physics and mathematics better. Files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded free
